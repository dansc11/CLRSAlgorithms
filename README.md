### CLRSAlgorithms

Algorithms faithful to the CLRS Algorithms book

- Bubble Sort $O(n^2)$
- Insertion Sort $O(n^2)$
- Quick Sort $O(n lg n)$
- Merge Sort $O(n lg n)$
- Heap Sort $O(n lg n)$
- Queue 
- Stack
- Linked List
- Linked List with sentinel

All of the above have accompanying pytest unit tests 

Variations include:
- Bubble Sort rewritten to use recursion rather than nested loops
- Versions with print statements to demonstrate function
